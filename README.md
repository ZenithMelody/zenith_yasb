# My Personal YASB Configuration

This is a **personal modification** of the [Yet Another Startpage Builder (YASB)](https://github.com/amnweb/yasb-themes) originally created by [@amnweb](https://github.com/amnweb). Full credit goes to them for the original concept, structure, and themes. The theme I modified from is: [Comfyppuccin Reimagined](https://github.com/amnweb/yasb-themes/tree/main/themes/0992d77b-662a-4f6b-ad41-551279d4f716)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> **Note:** I am **not the original author** of this project. This repository contains a customized version of YASB to suit my personal aesthetic and functional preferences.
